By doing this project. I primary objective is to polish my skills of all the 
data structures that I have seen in my university course CMPT 280. Would be 
using his book as references to understand and implement it in C. In CMPT 280,
Java was used to implement these data structures but I would be using C to 
implements all the data structure learned in CMPT 280.

My secondary objective is to strength the use of pointers and Makefiles.
